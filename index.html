            <h3>A*</h3>
            <p>The A* algorithm is a method for finding the shortest path on a graph that uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the path to the goal, combining a greedy approach taking into account the distance already traveled.</p>

            <h3>Ð¡lustering algorithm</h3>
            <p>The clustering algorithm groups objects into clusters so that objects are similar within one cluster and different between different clusters.</p>

            <h3>Ant algorithm</h3>
            <p>You place the points on the plane - the vertices of the graph. The algorithm builds a traveling salesman's path based on this</p>

            <h3>Genetic algorithm</h3>
            <p>You arrange the vertices of the graph on the plane. Edge weights are the distances on the plane between the vertices. The algorithm builds a traveling salesman's path along this graph.</p>

            <h3>Decision tree</h3>
            <p>You enter a training sample in csv text format, which is used to build a decision tree. Next, you can enter data in csv format to make a decision on the tree.</p>

            <h3>Neural network</h3>
            <p>You draw a number on a 5x5 pixel field, and the algorithm shows you which number you entered.</p>
